# Crowd finding
## Web application to host a music competition
### Milestone project 3 for Code Institute

### Deployed version 
[https://crowd-finding.herokuapp.com/](https://crowd-finding.herokuapp.com/)

The purpose of this application is to host a competition of musical tracks for starting musicians. Artists can post a track that theyâ€™ve hosted on soundcloud. Visitors of the website can then vote on wich track they think is the best and leave a short motivation as to why they like the track. After a pre-defined period of time the website owner can take the best voted 5 songs and distribute these as an album on spotify, itunes and vinyl. The app will also give insight on why some tracks are liked more than others.  In addition the owner will build up a database of e-mail addresses of interested users to use for targeted advertising.
